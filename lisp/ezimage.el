;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A few routines for placing an image over text that will work for any
;; Emacs implementation without error.  When images are not supported, then
;; they are just not displayed.
;;
;; The idea is that gui buffers (trees, buttons, etc) will have text
;; representations of the GUI elements.  These routines will replace the text
;; with an image when images are available.
